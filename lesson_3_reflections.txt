When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I would want to use a remote repository while working on a project with multiple people.
Another reason to keep a remote repository would be to allow me to work on my project if my
personal machine was not available or if something happened to it. The remote repository would
allow me to continue working on the project.
